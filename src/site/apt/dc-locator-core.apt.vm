Using Active Directory DC Locator Core

  The {{{./active-directory-dc-locator-core/}DC Locator Core}} is only required if you want to perform
  low-level requests/operations/testing of DNS SRV lookups, LDAP pings or both combined in the DC
  locator process.

* Components

  It consists of the following components:

  * <<<ActiveDirectoryDnsLocator>>>: Locates various services via DNS SRV lookups.

  * <<<ActiveDirectoryLdapPinger>>>: Sends an LDAP ping to probe a domain controller for liveliness
    and capabilities.

  * <<<ActiveDirectoryDcLocator>>>: Combines both of the above to locate domain controllers and probe
    them.

  []

* Testing

  Before deploying to production you can test all three of them with classes from the tests JAR.
  Each of the above components has a <<<\{component\}TestDataGenerator>>> and a <<<\{component\}Tester>>>
  class. The <<<ActiveDirectoryLdapPinger>>> has also an <<<ActiveDirectoryLdapPingerDumpPrinter>>>.
  See their {{{./active-directory-dc-locator-core/testapidocs/}Test Javadocs}} for details.
